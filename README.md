# django mongodb

Simple template django+mongodb for cookiecutter. :smile:

How to use:

```
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/AndersonFirmino/django-mongodb
```

You will be questioned about your name, project name, bank of mongodb and etc.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:(Note) This template use the django 1.6.11 by default.  
Because until this moment, in your current versions, I did not find native support to mongodb.

Features:
   * Configuration to use with the Cloud Foundry (pivotal)  

Stars and Forks are always welcome :wink: :snake:
